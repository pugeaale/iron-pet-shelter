# Iron pet shelter

This is my final project of Ironhack backend bootcamp.

## Project description

The project is a web application that manages shelters.
The platform allows users to create or edit a shelter and also provides the option to add or update an animal.
A user can also create a profile and request an adoption.
The veterinarian adds medical procedures carried out on each animal, such as vaccinations.
Finally, shelter employees or volunteers record various activities, such as cleaning, walking, and training sessions.
